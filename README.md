## Notes

During the development process, I encounter challenges with `CSS` styling for `React` components since I was new to React so I
was not used to designing like with HTML tag, especially the traditional `style` tag in `HTML` is not allowed in `React`. Therefore, I
invested a lot of time trying to make my page to be a desired user-friendly and multi-device adaptable website.
